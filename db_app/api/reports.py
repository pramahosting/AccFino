"""
db_app/api/reports.py
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Real financial reports computed from actual user data -- replaces the
hardcoded demo numbers that used to live in
frontend/src/pages/accounting/FinancialReports.jsx (PL, BS, AR, AP
constants with invented company names like "Acme Corporation").

Data sources:
  - transactions table (gl_account, debit, credit) -- posted/reconciled txns
  - chart_of_accounts table (name -> type: Revenue, Direct Costs, Expense,
    Fixed Asset, Inventory, Equity, GST)
  - account_balances table -- real per-account bank balances
  - invoices table -- real customer invoices with due_date/status for aging

Honesty note: this Chart of Accounts doesn't distinguish "Bank" or
"Current Liability" as their own types (see chart_of_accounts.type values),
so the Balance Sheet below is built only from sections that map onto real,
existing COA types -- it does not invent categories the data can't support.
There is also no bills/purchases model in this app at all, so Aged Payables
has no real data source; that endpoint returns an explicit "not available"
response rather than fabricating supplier data.
